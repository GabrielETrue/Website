            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>
                    I was hooked on you from the first time we talked. One convo and I was addicted.
                Even though we were just in the Reg, you stopping by was basically the easiest flowing conversation of all time. 
                Everything was so natural, and I just couldn't stop smiling. We got along so well, had a lot of similar experiences (Customer service at 
                Walmart and Cracker Barrel), you made me laugh so easily, and it definitely didn't hurt that you're
                GORGEOUS. The fact that I knew I liked you from one single convo at the reg was crazy
            </p>
            <p>
                    From there, every single thing just confirmed what I already knew. Every single coffee chat. The texting.
                And then Sushi San. You mentioned Sushi San last night and it was crazy that I had just been thinking about it too.
                It was such a great night, and I also replay it over and over again. From there everything progressed and here we are today.
                I'm so happy, and I can't wait to make even more memories with you.

                I love this picture of us. I know you've seen it a bunch
                (I certainly have). Still, it never gets old. People 
                are saying that we look really good together. We need more pics.

            <h2>Today</h2>
            <p>
                Where we are now is CRAZY. I get to call you every day.
                I hear your voice. I get to come see you. To me, all of this is insane.
                Who would have thought that one little conversation would lead to this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love all the little things with you. From our nightly calls (Even just having you in the background when sleeping), to the texts throughout the day.
                From your moments of laughter to your moments of being dramatic (Don't shoot the messenger).
                You're everything I want, and I'm so glad that today I can sit down, make this page, and it be appropriate.
