            <p>
                This is where I document the work that I am currently on. This includes things I am working on personally.
                This could include projects, libraries learning, books reading, etc. Here are a few things at the moment that
                are top priorities for me
            </p>
            <h2 class ='work-item'>Personal Website</h2>
            <p>This website is a work in progress. Building the framework and content certaintly takes time. At the moment, my time is spent setting
                up the pages. Because I am committing to developing the entire of the website entirely by hand without AI input, the progress is slower
                than simply vibe coding many of the pages, animations, designs, etc. However, through this project, I hope to enhance my web development
                skills and strengthen basic understandings of how website operation works.
            </p>
            <h2 class="work-item">Data Science Setup</h2>
            <p>My full-time position as an Associate Data Scientist at Aimpoint Digital begins no July 7th. Leading up to that, I am working on
                reviewing content related to data science including statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and coding competency.
            </p>
            <h2 class="'work-item">Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization</h2>
            <p>As machine learning is an area I find fascinating, continuing to grow my skills within the area is crucial for me. Therefore,
                I am spending my time deepening my understanding of concepts in the field. One example in this field is neural networks. This course
                on deep learning is a highly regarded source for those familiar with the field hoping to strengthen their comprehension of the field.
