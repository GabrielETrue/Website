            <p>
                This is where I document the work that I am currently on. This includes things I am working on personally.
                This could include projects, libraries learning, books reading, etc. Here are a few things at the moment that
                are top priorities for me
            </p>
            <h2 class = 'update-time'> Last Updated: Aug 2nd, 2025 </h2>
            <h2 class ='work-item'>Personal Website</h2>
            <p>Currently, I'm working on setting this site up to be aligned with my vision. However, work is currently slow on the website,
                so progress certainly takes a considerable amount of time.
            </p>
            <h2 class="work-item">Data Science Setup</h2>
            <p>My full-time position as an Associate Data Scientist at Aimpoint Digital begins no July 7th. Leading up to that, I am working on
                reviewing content related to data science including statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and coding competency.
            </p>
            <h2 class="'work-item">Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization</h2>
            <p>As machine learning is an area I find fascinating, continuing to grow my skills within the area is crucial for me. Therefore,
                I am spending my time deepening my understanding of concepts in the field. One example in this field is neural networks. This course
                on deep learning is a highly regarded source for those familiar with the field hoping to strengthen their comprehension of the field.
