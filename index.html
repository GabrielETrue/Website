                <h1>Quick Bio</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm <b>Gabriel True</b>. I was born in Germany, spent almost a decade in California, grew up in Kentucky, and studied in Chicago. 
                    Now I live in Atlanta, working full-time as a <b>data scientist</b>. I've always gravitated toward math and science — I entered my first 
                    math competition in kindergarten and even made a YouTube channel in middle school breaking down the science behind 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)"><i>The Martian</i></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I competed nationally in math and science competitions, which pushed me toward studying <b>Computer Science and Economics 
                    at the University of Chicago</b>. I ended up specializing in <b>data science and machine learning</b>. These are areas I enjoy because they combine math, 
                    creativity, and real-world problem solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I like to travel, explore new interests, and challenge myself in different ways — right now, that includes learning piano 
                    and working on personal projects. I'm always looking for new ways to grow.

                <h1> Educational Background </h1>
                <h2> The University of Chicago</h2>
                <p>The University of Chicago was the perfect place to discover my intellectual interests while gaining a cross-disciplinary education.
                    Specifically within my areas of study, I've narrowed my coursework down to the 4 most impactful classes from my time at the College.
                    Coincidentally, all three classes were either graduate classes or classes dual-listed as both undergraduate and graduate level.
                </p>
                <section class = 'classes'>
                    <div class = 'combinatorics'>
                        <h3>Honors Combinatorics</h3>
                        <p>The most difficult class I encountered during my time at the University of Chicago. Taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">László Babai</a>,
                        I certainly learned the value of time management in this class. What fascinated me so much about this class was the way we would learn
                        a specific sub-field of math in detail in order to logically deduce and prove fundamental discoveries prevalent in statistics and probability theory.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = 'lsda'>
                        <h3>Machine Learning and Large Scale Data Analysis</h3>
                        <p> After taking several classes in machine learning, this was the culmination of all I had learned. Mathematically rigorous and practicial, 
                            we spent half the time mathematically proving the fundamental equations behind essential (and more esoteric) models within machine learning, and 
                            the other half coding practical models to apply theory such as sentiment analysis, classification, and diffusion models.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = 'scivis'>
                        <h3>Scientific Visualization</h3>
                        <p> Taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Kindlmann">Gordon Kindlmann</a>, this class was the perfect marriage of coding and mathematics. We implemented various linear algebra and vector calculus techniques such as 
                            convolution and tensor operations in C to create projects such as a volume renderer and isocontour mapper. Programming in C, we had the opportunity to leverage
                            parallel computer and optimization of memory.

                        <h3>Causal Inference</h3>
                        <p>
                            In my previous statistics classes, I was warned about the dangers of making causal claims from metrics obtained through statistical 
                            analysis. This class provided me the opportunity to finally make these claims and understand the underlying assumptions necessary to 
                            perform Causal Analyses.
                        </p>

                <p> My trajectory has not been linear and this has provided me an enriching wealth of experiences which
                    have contributed to what I bring to a job.

                    <p>
                        Working at CareerVillage helped provide me the tools that I use to this day in the field of data science. Through PostgreSQL
                        and BigQuery queries, I was able to help integrate data into dashboards for both technical and nontechnical teams. Using hundreds of 
                        thousands of LLM logs, I performed sentiment analysis on the chats. Using these findings and a variety of statistical analyses, I sought
                        to identify age-related bias in chats. Furthermore, I helped to refactor a OpenAI summarization program. In doing so, I developed
                        a recursive summarization pipeline.

                        At AlphaOcean, I had the opportunity to implement a variety of programmed deliverables. Using monaco library in Python and data such
                        as oil spot & future prices and maritime searoutes, I helped to develope a monte carlo simulation to advise ships on optimal fueling
                        routes based on fuel pricing. Furthermore, due to fuel commingling constraints, we had enough information to implement a linear
                        programming algorithm (Through the PuLP library) which informed ships of their prior fueling allocations if they had lost
                        track of which tank they fueled.

                    <p>
                        At Shepherd Ventures, I was placed on the "AI Injection Team". Essentially, this meant that my specific job was to help integrate
                        machine learning capabilities within the investing scheme. With the team, I helped combine the Davies-Bouldin Index with a modified Kmean Clustering
                        algorithm to establish an asset preselection algorithm. From there, I used and helped integrate a variety of techniques to help forecast volatility
                        and optimize portfolio weighting. Forecasting techniques included ARMA, GARCH, and EGARCH models on public, historic financial data. Furthermore, 
                        we utilized mean-variance optimization to ascertain the optimal weighting of assets.

                    <p>
                        I worked part-time here during college for around a year. One of my primary jobs was helping run, modify, and create pages on
                        the physics department's website. Doing this oftentimes required open communication and compromise. For example, some individual researchers
                        may request a more personalized profile on the website while protocol would require a particular template. Communicating with the department 
                        heads and these researchers helped reach a compromise. Other than that, I was tasked with gathering, analyzing, and presenting data pertaining to both the website and other
                        events held by the physics department.

                        While not as technically advanced as the other positions, this was a great beginning to the world of business. As a
                        strategic partnerships intern, a lot of my work revolved around researching best practices and tips that TechSoup partnered
                        with. In particular, I researched CSR & ESG trends in companies partnered with TechSoup to understand how to coordinate with the missions
                        of such companies. When collecting internal data, I was offered the chance to use <b>PowerBI</b>. I was granted the opportunity to interview
                        some of TechSoup's corporate partner representatives, and I presented the findings of my research to the company -- including executives.
                        This was a great opportunity to develop some of the soft skills that I use to this day.
