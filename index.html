                <h1>Quick Bio</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm <b>Gabriel True</b>. I was born in Germany, spent almost a decade in California, grew up in Kentucky, and studied in Chicago. 
                    Now I live in Atlanta, working full-time as a <b>data scientist</b>. I've always gravitated toward math and science — I entered my first 
                    math competition in kindergarten and even made a YouTube channel in middle school breaking down the science behind 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)"><i>The Martian</i></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school, I competed nationally in math and science competitions, which pushed me toward studying <b>Computer Science and Economics 
                    at the University of Chicago</b>. I ended up specializing in <b>data science and machine learning</b>. These are areas I enjoy because they combine math, 
                    creativity, and real-world problem solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I like to travel, explore new interests, and challenge myself in different ways — right now, that includes learning piano 
                    and working on personal projects. I'm always looking for new ways to grow.
                </p>

                <h1> Educational Background </h1>
                <h2> The University of Chicago</h2>
                <p>The University of Chicago was the perfect place to discover my intellectual interests while gaining a cross-disciplinary education.
                    Specifically within my areas of study, I've narrowed my coursework down to the 4 most impactful classes from my time at the College.
                    Coincidentally, all three classes were either graduate classes or classes dual-listed as both undergraduate and graduate level.
                </p>
                <section class = 'classes'>
                    <h3>Honors Combinatorics</h3>
                    <p>The most difficult class I encountered during my time at the University of Chicago. Taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">László Babai</a>,
                    I certainly learned the value of time management in this class. What fascinated me so much about this class was the way we would learn
                    a specific sub-field of math in detail in order to logically deduce and prove fundamental discoveries prevalent in statistics and probability theory.</p>
                    <h3>Machine Learning and Large Scale Data Analysis</h3>
                    <p> After taking several classes in machine learning, this was the culmination of all I had learned. Mathematically rigorous and practicial, 
                        we spent half the time mathematically proving the fundamental equations behind essential (and more esoteric) models within machine learning, and 
                        the other half coding practical models to apply theory such as sentiment analysis, classification, and diffusion models.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scientific Visualization</h3>
                    <p> Taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Kindlmann">Gordon Kindlmann</a>, this class was the perfect marriage of coding and mathematics. We implemented various linear algebra and vector calculus techniques such as 
                        convolution and tensor operations in C to create projects such as a volume renderer and isocontour mapper. Programming in C, we had the opportunity to leverage
                        parallel computer and optimization of memory.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Causal Inference</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my previous statistics classes, I was warned about the dangers of making causal claims from metrics obtained through statistical 
                        analysis. This class provided me the opportunity to finally make these claims and understand the underlying assumptions necessary to 
                        perform Causal Analyses.

                <h1> Experience </h1>
                <p> My trajectory has not been linear and this has provided me an enriching wealth of experiences which
                    have contributed to what I bring to a job.

                <h2>Current Employment: Associate Data Scientist | Aimpoint Digital</h2>
                <p>
                    Aimpoint Digital is a <b>Data and AI</b> consulting firm. I am currently employed as an Associate Data Scientist
                    going through the New Consultant Development Program (NCDP).
                </p>

                <h2>Data Analyst | CareerVillage</h2>
                <p>
                    As a data analyst, I had a fairly broad exposure to the world that I am pursuing further in the field of data science.
                    
                </p>

                <h2>Quantitative Developer Intern | AlphaOcean</h2>
                <p>
                    At AlphaOcean, I got a crash course in the world of quantitative research and trading tools. I worked on optimization algorithms
                    to improve the efficiency of portfolio backtesting and implemented Monte Carlo simulations for risk modeling. It was a great 
                    intro to financial data and the speed and precision needed to work with it — and it pushed me to think more carefully about performance
                    and complexity, especially when deploying models across different client environments.
                </p>

                <h2>Quantitative Analyst Intern | Shepherd Ventures</h2>
                <p>
                    My work here focused on building predictive models for financial time series. I trained and evaluated a range of volatility models,
                    including GARCH and EGARCH, and used PCA to reduce dimensionality in multi-asset portfolios. I also helped the team run scenario-based
                    stress tests on investment strategies. This internship was the point where my interest in statistical modeling really clicked with
                    the financial world.
                </p>

                <h2>Student Technological Assistant | University of Chicago Department of Physics</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked part-time here during college, supporting the department’s web tools and internal data tracking systems. It wasn’t glamorous work,
                    but it helped me get comfortable with a lot of the operational side of coding — debugging old scripts, dealing with mismatched data formats,
                    optimizing Excel processes, and helping staff interpret their usage dashboards. More than anything, it taught me how to make things that just work.
